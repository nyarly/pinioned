This is a test project to try to demonstrate some benefits of Pinion 
(nyarly/pinion) by unrolling the standard Rails middleware stack into a Pinion 
chain of steps.  

The actual steps are all laid out in lib/rails-pinion-steps.rb

The performance of the application is tested by test/performance/folks_test.rb
(This file also includes the beginnings of more useful perf testing for Rails.)

Otherwise, it's a very simple Rails app - at little as possible has been 
changed.

A sketch of how to run the tests and get perf data:

Run the test in test/performance/folks_test.rb

If BASE_RAILS is set, it will run with the normal Rack stack and output data to "tmp/base_benchmarking"

If not, it will use Pinion steps and output to "tmp/benchmarking"

You can then use perf2gnuplot.rb to generate gnuplot .p files that include linear fittings.

My output for performance is here in wall_time.png as well as perftools 
profiles in BR_profile.gif ("base rails": without Pinion) and profile.gif (with 
Pinion)
