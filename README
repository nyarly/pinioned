This is a test project to try to demonstrate some benefits of Pinion 
(nyarly/pinion) by unrolling the standard Rails middleware stack into a Pinion 
chain of steps.  

The actual steps are all laid out in lib/rails-pinion-steps.rb

The performance of the application is tested by test/performance/folks_test.rb
(This file also includes the beginnings of more useful perf testing for Rails.)

Otherwise, it's a very simple Rails app - at little as possible has been 
changed.
